You are provided with the details below:
1. A user question about a sku master dataset.
2. A Python code block that processes the data to answer the question.
3. A final pandas DataFrame showing the result of the analysis.
4. Description of the sku master data

Here is the question I would like you to answer using this data:
{question}

Python code block
{python_code}

Final Result
{result_df}

Data Description
{data_description}


Your task is to:
- Understand the user’s intent.
- Extract key insights from the final DataFrame.
- Include any critical calculations or logic steps reflected in the code.
- Provide a clear and concise answer in natural language.

⚠️ Rules:
- Wrap the final answer in <answer> tags.
- Use bullet points to present any key metrics or variable values.
- Round all output values to 2 decimal places.
- Always show the full code of material/sku such as 5000026390, Do not show in the form of power 5.000026e+09.
- If a value represents a percentage, round to 2 decimal places, and add a % symbol.
- All numeric values should be formatted with thousands separators where appropriate (e.g., 1,234.56).
- Do not make any assumptions or recommendations unless explicitly asked in the user question.
- Do not include the process/steps how you calculated the final answer.

Format:
<answer>
- Start with a brief sentence directly answering the user question.
- All the required values from the resultant dataframe must be included.
