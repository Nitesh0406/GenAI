These KPIs are based on aggregate calculations across multiple rows. These calculations are meaningful only after the data is grouped by a relevant dimension (e.g., customer, month, or year).
📌 Important Instructions:
-Always group the data first by the correct column(s) based on the user question (e.g., SHIP_TO_NAME, GROWTH_SEGMENTS, CUSTOMER_NAME for customer-level KPIs, or Month for monthly trends).
-Then, apply the KPI formula within each group using .groupby(...).agg(...) or .apply(...)
-Do not compute aggregate KPIs directly on the full DataFrame unless the user question explicitly asks for an overall summary.

🔍 Example: For Full Shippers %
Correct Code:
result_df = df.groupby('SHIP_TO_NAME').apply(
    lambda g: g['FS_UNITS'].sum() / g['ORDERED_QTY'].sum() if g['ORDERED_QTY'].sum() > 0 else 0
).reset_index(name='Full Shippers %')

Incorrect Code:
df['Full Shippers %'] = df['FS_UNITS'].sum() / df['ORDERED_QTY'].sum()
result_df = df.groupby('SHIP_TO_NAME').agg({'Full Shippers %': 'sum'})
