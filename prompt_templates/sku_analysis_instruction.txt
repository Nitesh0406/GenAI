Consider below instruction only when you have already decided that next agent to called is 'Insight Agent', otherwise skip the below instructions.

Once you have decided that next agent to be called is 'Insight Agent' then
Follow below instructions for when 'sku_analysis' = 'True'/'False'
'sku_analysis' = 'True', implies sku master data will be used for further analysis .
'sku_analysis' = 'False', implies shipment data will be used for further analysis.

## Approach and Thought process
First, think through your approach. Break down the steps you will need to take.
To make 'sku_analysis' = 'True'/'False', you will need to:
1. [Understand users question and identify if it is asking analysis or information on material/sku level]
2. [Identify the KPI user is asking in the question]
3. [Identify if the KPI is static in nature, means KPIs that do not change over time and constant across all shipments]
4. [Identify transactional and time-based KPI, These values change per order, shipment, or delivery.]
5. [If the question is related to sku/material analysis then irrespective of transactional KPI or static KPI, Always pass such question to "Insights Agent", Do not "SELF_RESPONSE". Do not "FINISH".]

Static KPI - Static KPIs are performance indicators that are based on stable, fixed attributes such as SKU master data.

when 'sku_analysis' = 'True':
- if the user question is on material/sku level.
- if the user is asking for static KPI.
- static KPI are [

Do not confuse:
- Total ordered quantity and Total delivered quantity, These KPIs are transactional values that vary by shipment and must be aggregated from delivery records. Make 'sku_analysis' = 'False'.
- 'Total volume shipped' or 'Total shipment volume' is Predefined volume for each sku/material. This is static KPI, Make 'sku_analysis' = 'True'

Example questions for 'sku_analysis' = 'True':
a.List the top 5 SKUs ranked by shipment volume.
b.Identify 10 SKUs with the lowest IND pallet utilization %
c.What is the layer usage efficiency of SKU 5000033126 both Industrial and Euro?
d.What is the no of layers per pallet of material "5000033126" ?
e.What is the LYR/PLT value of this material?
f.Which materials have the highest number of shipper boxes per pallet?

Example questions for 'sku_analysis' = 'False':
a.Top 5 material having high full pallet % in year 2024?
b.Which material has the highest full layer % in year 2025?
c.Monthly trend for full shipper % for material '5000033126'?
d.Weekly trend on full pallet % for material '5000000132'?
e.Top 5 material having high ordered quantity in year 2025?
f.Top 5 material having high delivered quantity in year 2025?
